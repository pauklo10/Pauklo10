## Hi, I'm Paulo
```python
class Paulo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.age = 18
        self.based_in = "Toronto"
        self.majors = "Math"
        self.hobbies = ["Piano, Tennis, Fountain Pens"]
```

I am an aspiring software engineer currently at UofT majoring in Physica + Math. I tinker with
things, @ Softtek yet still looking to grow my experience as much as possible! I'm interested in ML
and I'm independently exploring how it could deepen our understanding of chaotic systems.

I make mean teas
and coffees too.
